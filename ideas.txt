So. There is this base, from which you send out rogues with preset equip and abilities. 
They die, you get their earns. 
Almost always end up with more. 
Basic combat system. You eventually kill like an epic final boss. First time like 1 h, speedrun about 20 mins. + Endless mode.
Wild animals better not get to your base.
Creatures keep getting stronger.
Pause option rather than turns. Just build your stuff and watch it work.
Keep it fucking simple. No races, only humans. Racist and proud. You set hp, att, equip. General direction and go.
Special abilities appear as you progress.
 - crit
 - dodge
 
What about parties? Huh? I imagined it without them, but now I don't really know...
Roguelike is all about solo, let's keep it that way.

Bosses. You have to make like a super hero and send it out.

Mystery chests with items. Basic for one use, epics that you get to keep.

Make killing satisfying.

Keep it in a grid. A huge one. There is this base pane with everything and a kind of overlook + scrollable map.

This is good.
